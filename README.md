# work-day-scheduler

## This code project is a scheduler that allows you to insert events into the time slots to make managing your day and tasks much easier. When you click on the row that you want to add an event to you will be provided a text box, once you are finished, clicking on the blue save icon directly to the right of the text box will save it. Clicking on the row again will allow you to edit it. There is also a time stamp at the top of the app that tells you the current day in DDDD, MMMM Do format. The rows will either have a grey, red, or green background, for past, present, future respectively. This will automatically change every hour, as well on page load. Your events will also persist through page reloads.
